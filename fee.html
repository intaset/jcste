      <h2>Publishing Fee</h2>
      <p class="body">Avestia Publishing has adapted the open access model for JCSTE. This ensures free public access to all the articles and material with no subscription fees, which often results in a larger audience and higher citations.</p>

      <p class="body">In the open access format all publication costs are paid for by the authors. These costs are often considered part of the research expenses and are paid for or reimbursed by affiliated institutions or funding agencies.</p>

      <p class="body">Publication fee covers the entire publication process including the editorial management, peer-review, language copy-editing, typesetting, reference validation and linking, DOI purchase, submission to indexing platforms, and online hosting.</p>

      <p class="body">At this time, processing charges are waived and articles submitted to JCSTE via <a href="amss.avestia.com" class="body-link">Avestia Manuscript Submission System (AMSS)</a> will be published <i>free of charge</i> (successive to peer-review).</p>
